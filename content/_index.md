# Engineering Management Journey

Lost wanderer, welcome to the pages of my humble blog. Since you've found yourself here, it's worth outlining the configuration of this place. First, this diary is filled with misconceptions and wrong judgments—don't look for truth here. This is the logbook of an unfortunate sailor who, by the will of chance, was swept into the turbulent sea of managing processes and people. Second, there are no instructions here; the curious reader can observe a chronicle of reflections and an attempt to build a system that could be followed to minimize the damage inflicted by corporate processes on efficiency and quality of software development (as well as on one's own mental health).

## About myself

Since you're on the pages of this blog, I think you have a reasonable question - who is this random nobody, and why should you care about his opinion? In principle, it's not yet clear whether there's any value in this blog, except for one obvious one—people always love to read about the suffering of others.

Briefly about me: My professional path began in academic science, where I worked in quantum physics. Already during my PhD, my idealism was broken by the soulless machine of capitalism, and I started programming. By the way, this was quite close to me because in exact sciences you have to write quite a lot of code (though of a slightly different nature). My IT career started with Data Science, ML Learning, and then shifted toward pure engineering. I've been working in development for about 10 years with different technologies and languages. I don't think I became an outstanding programmer, but I was smart enough to understand this in time and manage to find my truly strong sides. In any team, I quickly earned authority, a leadership reputation, and became a leader either unofficially or was officially promoted to team lead and, recently, to engineering manager. As I already said, this was never related to my exceptional technical talents. More on this below.
