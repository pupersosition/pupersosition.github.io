As engineering managers, we're constantly under pressure to make decisions quickly. Deadlines loom, stakeholders want answers, and the team looks to us for guidance. But there's a dangerous trap we can fall into: making conclusions too fast without gathering the full context.

## The Temptation of Quick Judgments

It's easy to see a situation and immediately think we understand what's happening. A developer is consistently late to meetings? They must not care about the team. A project is behind schedule? The team must not be working hard enough. A bug made it to production? Someone wasn't paying attention.

These snap judgments feel satisfying because they give us a sense of control and understanding. But they're often wrong, and acting on them can cause real damage.

## The Real Cost of Hasty Conclusions

When we jump to conclusions, we risk:

- **Damaging relationships**: Accusing someone of not caring when they're actually struggling with personal issues
- **Missing root causes**: Blaming individuals when the real issue is process or communication
- **Creating a culture of fear**: Team members become afraid to make mistakes or speak up
- **Making poor decisions**: Basing actions on incomplete information

## A Personal Example

I once had a developer who seemed disengaged during team meetings. I quickly concluded they weren't interested in the project and started thinking about how to address their "attitude problem." 

Before acting, I decided to have a one-on-one conversation. It turned out they were dealing with a serious family health crisis and were actually working extra hours to keep up. My initial conclusion couldn't have been more wrong.

## How to Slow Down Your Thinking

Here are some practices I've found helpful:

### 1. Ask Questions First
Before forming any conclusions, ask yourself:
- What else could be true?
- What information am I missing?
- What assumptions am I making?

### 2. Gather More Context
- Have one-on-one conversations
- Look at the data from multiple angles
- Consider the broader context and history

### 3. Separate Facts from Interpretations
- What actually happened? (fact)
- What do I think it means? (interpretation)
- What else could it mean? (alternative interpretations)

### 4. Give People the Benefit of the Doubt
Assume good intentions until proven otherwise. Most people want to do good work and contribute positively to the team.

## The Power of Pausing

Sometimes the best action is no action at all. When you feel the urge to make a quick judgment, pause. Take a breath. Ask for more information. Give yourself time to think.

This doesn't mean you should never make decisions quickly - sometimes speed is essential. But it does mean being more intentional about when and how you form conclusions.

## Building a Better Habit

I've started making it a practice to:
- Always have a conversation before forming strong opinions about people
- Look for patterns over time rather than reacting to single events
- Ask "what else could be true?" when I feel certain about something
- Share my thinking process with the team so they understand my approach

## Conclusion

Making fast conclusions is a natural human tendency, but it's particularly dangerous for engineering managers. Our decisions affect people's careers, team dynamics, and project outcomes. Taking the time to gather context and consider alternatives isn't just good management - it's essential for building trust and making better decisions.

The next time you feel certain about something, pause and ask yourself: "What else could be true?" You might be surprised by what you discover.
